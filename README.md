These are some notes, where I've been studying browser and device notifications.

 Sns Client is a good usage for email dhe device notifications. 
 
 Web push is a library used for browser notifications.
 
  Even though I suggest using a third party(or infrastructure solvings like lamda and dynamo db)  for managing notifications related requests from client side.
